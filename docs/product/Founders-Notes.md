# Founders Notes (Contextual Platform)

Last updated: 2026-01-17

## Roles
- Katie leads pitch, business strategy, final design decisions.
- Product/platform owner: full stack delivery (storage, APIs, clients, iOS UX).

## Core product intent
- Contextual is a proactive ambient AI platform; no default chat UI.
- Tink (working name) is the personal agent, born at account creation.
- Tink is a champion for the user, proactive but never noisy.
- Experience is screen-light: haptic on wrist, optional whisper in ear.
- Tink learns via behavior, not forms; long-term preferences persist.
- Each user has a persistent AI thread; one agent instance per user.
- Vertical spaces are first-class: floor bands and tight micro-zones (~4 ft).

## Experience flow (v0 demo)
1. User crosses a geolocation gate (Contextual Zone).
2. Haptic nudge on wrist (watch preferred).
3. Optional ASMR whisper ("psst...") via phone or AirPods.
4. User taps to reveal a guided host card (no blank chat screen).

## Setup + onboarding
- Onboarding is conversational.
- 3P integrations are permissioned (Google, Apple, Facebook, retail, etc).
- Integrations power context-aware triggers for the right person at the right time.

## Demo playground
- Frontier Tower, 995 Market St, SF.
- 16 floors; use altimeter for precise floor location.
- Demo includes an AI floor with members who love interactive environments.

## Platform direction
- This becomes a SaaS platform for partners (retail, parks, government, venues).
- Partners target only qualified, in-context humans; friends may receive different experiences.
- The user stays present in the world; Contextual does the work.

## Near-term priority
- Ship a reliable AI agent layer before over-indexing on front-end polish.
- Design gets refined once agent loop and trigger reliability are proven.
- Budget target for demo: ~$50 total (bootstrapped).

## Jan 26 product doc highlights
- Proactive, not reactive: no prompt-first interactions or chat UI.
- Ambient, not addictive: success metric is reduced cognitive load, not engagement.
- User sovereignty: partners are filtered; low-quality experiences are suppressed.
- Platform, not a single app: Contextual ID + agent persist across all entry points.
- Hardware-first: iPhone + Watch + AirPods; audio-first over screen-first.
- Interaction hierarchy: location trigger -> haptic -> whisper -> screen (only if needed).
